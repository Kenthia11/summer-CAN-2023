    "Pandas is a popular Python library utilized by many data scientists. It offers useful additional functionalities in Python that expand one's capability to store, organize, and analyze data. Additional data structures that comes with the pandas library are ***series*** and ***dataframes***. If you have experience in working with spreadsheets in Microsoft Excel, working with pandas series and dataframes will look familar. Essentially, series and dataframes allow for the storage of data in a tabular format. \n",
